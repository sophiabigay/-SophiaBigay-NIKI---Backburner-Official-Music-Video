                [VERSE 1]</br>
                I can't lie, it feels nice that you're calling</br>
                You sound sad and alone, and you're stalling</br>
                And for once, I don't care about what you want</br>
                As long as we keep talking (As long as we're talking)</br>
                I mean, you gotta admit the history's kind of unmatched</br>
                Asian Calvinism, we made it out of that</br>
                Well, whether we're free of will or predestined</br>
                Clearly, I've not learned my lesson even now</br>
                Hope He doesn't strike me down (Strike me down)</br></br>
            </li>
                <li>
                [PRE-CHORUS]</br>
                The Goo Goo Dolls are dead to me</br>
                The way you should bе, too</br>
                But you bring them up</br>
                Along with how much I fucking miss you</br></br>
            </li>
                <li>
                [CHORUS]</br>
                Maybe I'm just not bettеr than this, I haven't tried</br>
                Maybe life's less romantic when I don't wanna die</br>
                You'd think I'd be a fast learner</br>
                But guess I won't ever mind crisping up on your backburner</br></br>

            </li>
                <li>
                [POST-CHORUS]</br>
                Backburner</br>
                Your backburner</br>
                Your backburner</br>
                Your backburner</br></br>
            </li>
                <li>
                [VERSE 2]</br>
                It's pathetic, but at least you are, too</br>
                I don't know what to do</br>
                I don't like anyone except sometimes you</br>
                And now you're sounding like a hurt puppy</br>
                You look ugly when you cry</br>
                But I'm the one you think to call</br>
                How do you feel lucky and appalled at the same time?</br>
                After everything you put me through</br>
                I somehow still believe in you, oh-oh</br></br>
            </li>
                <li>
                [PRE-CHORUS 2]</br>
                But I know in a week or so</br>
                You'll fade away again</br>
                And I wish that I cared</br>
                Hey, are you still there?</br>
                Good</br></br>
            </li>
                <li>
                [CHORUS 2]</br>
                Maybe I'm just not better than this, I haven't tried</br>
               'Cause maybe you'll finally choose me after you've had more time</br>
                I thought I was a fast learner</br>
                But guess I won't ever mind, guess I won't ever mind</br>
                Maybe I blame my mother bleeding into my stride</br>
                Maybe it was my father and his wandering eyes</br>
               (It's their fault that) I'll always be in your corner</br>
               'Cause I don't feel alive 'til I'm burnin' on your backburner, oh-oh (Backburner, your backburner)</br></br>
            </li>
                <li>
                [OUTRO]</br>
                Oh, and I know that it's sad that I settle for the backburner, oh-oh</br>
                (Your backburner, your backburner)</br>
                (Your backburner, your backburner)</br>
                Oh, guess I won't ever mind crisping up on your backburner, oh-oh</br>
                (Your backburner, your backburner)</br>
                (Backburner, your backburner)</br>
                Oh, as long as you still think of me, oh, oh-oh</br>
                (Backburner, backburner)</br></br>
